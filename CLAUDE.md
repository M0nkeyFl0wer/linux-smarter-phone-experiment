# CLAUDE.md - Project Context and Instructions

## Project Overview

**Repository**: linux-smarter-phone-experiment
**GitHub**: https://github.com/M0nkeyFl0wer/linux-smarter-phone-experiment
**Owner**: Ben West (@M0nkeyFl0wer)
**Blog**: https://benwest.blog

## Project Description

The Linux Smart(er) Phone experiment is a project to transform Android phones (specifically OnePlus 7 Pro) into AI-powered Linux devices that can:

- Run Ubuntu Touch/PostmarketOS as the base OS
- Maintain Android app compatibility through Waydroid
- Use AI agents to automatically detect and fix app compatibility issues
- Learn and share fixes across the community
- Function as daily driver phones

### Key Goals

1. **Personal Experiment**: Ben is converting his actual OnePlus 7 Pro daily driver
2. **AI-Powered Fixing**: Automatic app compatibility diagnosis and repair
3. **Community Learning**: Shared fixes across all devices in the ecosystem
4. **Open Source**: Full GPL v3 project for community contribution

## Ben's Blog Writing Style

### Voice and Tone Analysis
- **Intellectual yet conversational**: Balances technical depth with accessibility
- **Socially conscious**: Connects technology to broader human/societal implications
- **Systems-oriented thinking**: Focuses on interconnections and underlying patterns
- **Slightly provocative**: Challenges existing paradigms without being confrontational
- **Optimistic problem-solver**: Solution-oriented approach to complex issues

### Technical Writing Approach
- Breaks down complex topics into accessible narratives
- Uses personal experiences and real-world examples
- Demonstrates expertise without being overly academic
- Starts with personal observations or questions
- Frames technical subjects through human impact lens

### Stylistic Characteristics
- Mix of short, punchy sentences and longer explanatory passages
- Conversational flow with occasional rhetorical questions
- Uses parenthetical asides to add context
- First-person perspective and personal journey
- Strategic use of images to complement written content

### Key Writing Principles
- Demystify complex systems
- Highlight tech/society/human behavior interconnections
- Encourage critical thinking and systemic understanding
- Bridge the gap between "cool demo" and "daily driver"

## Key Commands and Workflows

### Repository Management
- Always use descriptive commit messages with conventional commit format
- Tag releases with semantic versioning
- Document all changes in installation logs

### Blog Post Creation
- Use Ben's conversational, systems-thinking voice
- Start with personal observation or question
- Connect technical details to broader implications
- Include strategic images with descriptive alt text
- Link to the repository prominently

### Development Approach
- Focus on daily driver usability over pure experimentation
- Document everything, especially failures
- Prioritize community contribution and learning
- Balance technical innovation with practical constraints

## Important Context

### Device Information
- **Primary Target**: OnePlus 7 Pro (codename: guacamole)
- **Owner's Usage**: This is Ben's actual daily driver phone
- **Risk Tolerance**: High - willing to experiment on primary device
- **Documentation Goal**: Complete journey from working Android to working Linux Smart(er) Phone

### Community Aspects
- Open source (GPL v3)
- Community-driven development
- Shared learning and fix distribution
- Focus on enabling others to replicate the experiment

### Technical Philosophy
- Real Linux OS with Android compatibility layer
- AI-powered automatic problem solving
- Edge computing and local machine learning
- Open platform philosophy over locked-down systems

## Content Creation Guidelines

### For Blog Posts
1. Start with personal hook or observation
2. Explain the human/social context before diving into tech
3. Use conversational tone with technical accuracy
4. Include visual elements that enhance understanding
5. Connect to broader systems thinking themes
6. End with community invitation or next steps

### For Documentation
1. Assume technical competence but not specific domain knowledge
2. Provide both quick start and detailed options
3. Include troubleshooting and failure scenarios
4. Document the "why" behind technical decisions
5. Make it easy for others to contribute and extend

### For Commit Messages
Use conventional commit format:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation
- `test:` for testing
- Include detailed description of changes and rationale

## Memory Items for Future Sessions

1. **This is a real experiment**: Ben is actually using his daily driver phone
2. **Document everything**: Successes, failures, and everything in between
3. **Community focus**: Enable others to replicate and extend the work
4. **Systems thinking**: Always connect technical details to broader implications
5. **Daily driver standard**: Prioritize usability over pure experimentation
6. **Open source philosophy**: Full transparency and community contribution
